line 3: 5X: voltage multiplier for A B C D E channels
line 4: A: CV channel from 0 to 2 volts
line 5: B: CV channel from 0 to 2 volts
line 6: C: CV channel from 0 to 2 volts
line 7: D: CV channel from -1 to 1 volts
line 8: E: CV channel from -1 to 1 volts
line 9: MODE: TRIG mode; if bright yellow, CV and TRIG out, if dark yellow, only CV out, if black step is jumped
line 10: REP: if the sequencer is clocked will retrig the step from 1 to 8 times (subdivisions) (ratcheting)
line 11: TRIG OUT: single PULSE out when the stage is selected

SEL knob: will select the current stage
SEL CV input: selection of stage using CV (0 -> 10v)
CLK IN CLK OUT: to clock the sequencer (and output the same clock to other devices)
UP TRIG and BUTTON: if ON the sequence will go UP (normally is DOWN)
RND btn: if light up the next stage is randomized

OUTS A B C D E are the CV outs of the sequencer
ROT knob, from -5 to +5, is the number of steps the yellow channel will rotate jump and rotate  if in sequencer mode
LAST trig out: PULSE out when last step is reached
TRIG (global): current stage TRIG out (with repetitions if any)
CHAIN A B C D E  and CHAIN TRIG are useful when chaining many SQUONKs (to have just one connection for the CV and TRIGs)

    b) context menu "Full Reset"
    c) use the MAGNITUDE of H1 to establish a START RANGE for  random
    d) use the MAGN of H2 to establish an END RANGE for  random (repeat with phase and frequencies if you want animate them)
    e) context menu "Add 10 Random KFs"

    at this point you have an animation of 10 random KFs based on the input data.
    If you repeat the action, remember to do a `context menu "Full Reset"` (because the range now are changed!)

BUG: wrapping freq after feedback (to avoid freq clip modulations)

ADDENDA doc for the OP aka µOPERATOR
The CLOCK in is not a REAL CLOCK in, it's a PULSE IN for the internal
TIME COMPUTER.
The TC computes time average of last 4 pulses and tries to set the frequency.
If you use with wiggly clocks, or with random pulses you'll get strange results.
Per design the CLOCK IN win OVER the inner FREQUENCY, so we can use an external
LFO or CLOCK generator and sync many OP to an external TIME BASE
and detach it, and the OP continues to use that as BASEFREQ.
To regain ownership of the frequency, just move the TUNE pot
(after you have detached anything is connected to the CLOCK IN).

	0.6.39
feature request: added a contextual menu to choose if the UNSELECTED output (for BIVIO1 and BIVIO2) should output LAST VOLTAGE (kind of sample & hold), or 0 VOLTAGE

	0.6.40
---- add CHAIN OUT TRIG (to reuse the TRIG IN and easily chain it to the other TRIG or INPUTS)
---- add "routing probability mode" the probability  (using context menu)
in this new mode for the probability to go to A or to B
the starting position is not important
if the probability is at 5%, 19 times out of 20 will switch to A, always
---- the standard mode remain "switching probability mode"
is the probability to move from the current position
so the history is important,
for example if you are on B
and probability is at 5% means the only 1 times out of 20 (on average) the bivio switches to A
(and viceversa)

CONFUSINGSIMPLER
	0.6.23
---- It's an interactive sampler with many little features, and a couple of sequencers
---- Can load AIFF, or WAV 16bit or 24bit PCM ot WAV IEEE FLOAT formats

    Starting from TOP

    There are 2 inputs, if are connected the SOS (Sound on Sound) act as a mixer with control voltage
    so you can mix the incoming sound with inner sampled sound.
    If the 2 INPUTs are not connected the CONFUSINGSIMPLER can record onanistically itself during execution!
    To close the recording you can press or trig the REC button again.
    The Recording can be terminated also using 3 commands from contextual menu:
        ABORT RECORDING (sample is not substited and memory is freed)
        STOP RECORDING AND SAVE IN A FILE (a SAVE AS dialog is presented)
            you can do a lot of performances "recording itself" and save it and WASTING your HD !
        STOP RECORDING and APPEND to SAMPLE (the memory is appended to the current sample (a la morphagene...)

    TIME DISPLAY can display
        CURRENT SAMPLE SIZE
        CURRENT SELECTION TIME SIZE
        CURRENT SELECTION SAMPLES COUNT
        CURRENT PLAYHEAD TIME
        if RECORDING --> CURRENT RECORDING TIME

    SPEED
        SPEED default is 1.0 can go from -2 to +2 and can be CV controlled

    CV and OCTAVE
        of course you can use CONFUSINGSIMPLER as VCO or LFO

    YUMMER it's a little temporal effect to increase grains spread: can be activated,
        increased as effect and the level can be adjusted with LVL pot.

    THE GREEN PANEL, the MODULATION panel
    FM IN + CV
    the LFO value is added to the SPEED giving the SCRATCHY feel to the sample
    the WAVE SELECTOR for the inner LFO for SIN, TRI, SAW, SQUARE and S&H
    the LFO is driven by the FREQ control
    the value of the LFO is controlled by the DEPTH
    the DEPTH can be controlled via CV
    the inner LFO can have the PHASE reset using SYNC
    the inner frequency can be overridded using the TIME pulse input: a time computer will compute the pulse speed
    and set the LFO frequency.
    the LFO can be driven (I tested it) till 8kHz (CRAZY EFFECTS!)
    the FLAG UNI set the inner LFO to UNIPOLAR and the FLAG INVERT set UNIPOLAR in NEGATIVE

    THE PURPLE PANEL, the sample play control panel
    GATED is a flag, and the sample will play only if the GATE is HIGH using START BTN or TRIG IN START
    CYCLE a flag that sets the sample in LOOP
    TAP START and TRIG IN START to control the start or GATING of the SAMPLE
    TAP STOP-CONT and TRIG, controls the STOP and CONTINUE of a play
    if the sample is not in CYCLE, will end at the end of the current selection
    EOC is the End Of Cycle pulse out, a PULSE is generated all the times the sample hits the end of the selection
    START and STOP are control point of the selection (that is also the play zone area)
    Can be CV controlled
    ZOOM is just a visual zoom of samples

    THE GREEN PANEL, the GRID panel
    When active the sample is mapped with a grid. the number of elements in the grid are the SLICES
    the CURR display gives you info about the current selected SLICE
    the current slice can be selected using CV (from 0 to 10v)
    if the flag RND is active next slice is picked random at the EOC (internally):
    if you have the SAMPLE in CYCLE will create an infinite sequence of slices

    THE RED PANEL, the SLICES SEQUENCER PANEL
    it's a set of memories storing selection (Slices)
    Many commands are replicate in the contextual menu appearing on the WAVE DISPLAY
    if you want to delete ALL the SLICES you need to press option/windows key down
    during the command.
    SLICES SEQ display shows the current count of SLICES
    CURR display shows the current selected SLICE
    LOAD PULSE IN load the current slice as current playing selection
    ADD PULSE IN will create a new SLICE in the SEQUENCER with current sample selection
    UPD PULSE IN updates the current slice with data of current sample selection
    DEL PULSE IN deletes the current selected slice
    PREV TAP and PREV TRIG will go to the previous SLICE and LOAD it
    NEXT TAP and NEXT TRIG will go to the next SLICE and LOAD it
    CV will select a current slice using a Voltage from 0 to 10v
    a pulse in RND will select a random current SLICE from the available set

    the SAMPLE DISPLAY
    there are many commands in the contextual menu
    important commands are
    RESET SELECTION to MAX to set current sample selection to full sample size
    TRIM sample, zoom-in in the current selection
    UN-TRIM Sample zooms-out to full sample display
    RENDER SELECTION to Sample, the current selection becomes the
    new sample of the SIMPLER

    there are many small EDIT commands on the samples
    CUT
    COPY
    PASTE
    DELETE
    ZERO
    INVERT
    NORMALIZE
    AMPLIFY

    no more items... :D

ELSKER (the MULTITRIGDELAYER)
	0.6.39
it's a 12 trig/gate delay with a common global TRIG, or single TRIGs

parameters:
- GLOBAL TRIG/TAP to activate all the ACTIVE delayers at the same time
- single delayer
  - TRIG/TAP to start the delay
  - ACTIVATE TAP/TRIG to ACTIVATE/DEACTIVATE the delayer
  - DELAY draggable display: from 1 msec to 999 seconds: time to wait

(gate ON is 10 Volts)
  - GATE out is the GATE trig out the yellow LED will indicate current VOLTAGE status

	0.6.40
---- Added one shot mode: if active, the GLOBAL TRIG in will be valid only one time
and after the use the RESET button must be used to RESET the ONE SHOT mode
---- Added clock timing: the time of the clock in input is computed and used as timebase
for the GATE and DELAY operations.
If ELSKER is timed, the field represents multiple of the base time
there is: a CLOCK input, a display showing the frequency of the clock and
a display showing the time differential between pulses of the clock
---- Added Randomization to durations and delays: random is function of the current value in the field
for example if the field contains 0.123 seconds, the random can generate a new value that in the
200% range of the current value (in this case from 0.001 to 0.246.
if the delay is 0.000 the range will be considered 0.010
---- Added GLOBAL RESET TAP-TRIG. When hitting it every programmed gate will immediately stop
---- MIN time for delay is 0.000 so now can be also instantaneous on TRIG

(the more high current bias the more is recorded on top of old recorded data)

	0.6.42
---- exposed the inner LowPass filter: cutoff freq goes from 500Hz to 8kHz (added IN CV too)
---- boosted volume for summed nodes
---- add an all gray disk for people don’t want running disks (check in
YOURRACKINSTALL/plugins/nysthi/res/shapes/ and substitute the JIRAJIRADISK.svg)

	Addendum from Antonio (Edited for clarity)
"Regarding BIAS, it is the amount of current needed to overcome the recorded material.

If the Erase head is OFF, the magnetic disk contains relic recordings that are going to "fight" with incoming material with LEVEL "INPUT". The higher the BIAS, the higher the INPUT level must be to overcome the existing recorded material, but of course you are going to saturate!

The recording is always atomic, something is recorded (via swell/feedback) or not, The BIAS doesn't mix signal incoming and signals on disk, or one or the other, and can be from 1 single sample to 10 seconds, who knows!

So there are infinite combinations!"
